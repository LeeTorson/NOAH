## Set up
- Need to ensure you have everything on your machine

- Run `bower install`
- Run `npm install` to install everything (might need sudo)
- `gulp` to run it


## What SASS goes where?
- The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS. Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.
- The partials directory is where most of the CSS is constructed. The base styles are predefined at top level and then deeper folders are created as per your project requirements.

 
## Naming the folders
We currently have two folders assets and site. 
To help assist with the BE implementation we can rename the folders to match the project e.g.

- JNPR.Assets
- JNPR.Site
